Here's a quick song I came up with:

"Vikasni, oh Vikasni, you shine so bright
A ray of sunshine in the morning light
Your smile can light up the day
And chase all the worries away

You're a star that sparkles with glee
A treasure trove of happiness, you see
So here's to you, dear Vikasni, may your day be bold
Filled with laughter, love, and moments to behold!"

I hope this made Vikasni (and you!) smile!
